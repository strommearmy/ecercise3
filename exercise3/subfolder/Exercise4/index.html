            <h2>Would President Trump make a good comedian?</h2>
            <p>US President Donald Trump recently accused the media of not appreciating his sense of humour, when he went off script at this month's Conservative Political Action Conference. So we asked two comedians - one liberal, one conservative - to tell us just how funny he is.</p>

              <p>MPs have voted to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Theresa May said there was a "clear majority" against a no-deal Brexit but the "legal default" was that the UK would leave without a deal on 29 March if no deal is reached. MPs will now get a vote on delaying Brexit, said the prime minister. That vote will take place on Thursday, and if it is passed - and the EU agrees to it - the UK will not leave the EU as planned on 29 March. There could be a short extension - or a much longer one - depending on whether MPs backed her withdrawal deal "in the coming days", said the prime minister.

              <h3 class="snippet__title"><a href="#">Michael Jackson 'innocent' adverts to be removed</a></h3>
              <p>The decision comes after a sexual assault victims' charity said it was "concerned" about the adverts that have appeared on buses and bus stops. Posters were put up in response to a documentary in which the singer is accused of child sex abuse. The adverts have been financed through a crowdfunding campaign and feature the slogan: "Facts don't lie. People do." The Survivors Trust said the message could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. In a statement to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, TfL says: "We have reviewed our position and will be removing these advertisements. "They have been rejected due to the public sensitivity and concern around their content."

              <p>Gas heating for new houses will be banned by 2025, the Chancellor has said, although gas hobs will still be allowed. The homes will keep warm with devices such as heat exchangers - and with “world-leading” insulation standards. It’s part of a bid by Philip Hammond to address the concerns of children protesting about climate change. Green groups welcomed the measure but said the Chancellor had ducked major challenges on the climate. They wanted action to cut emissions from traffic, planes and existing draughty homes - which will form the vast majority of the housing stock for decades. Instead, Mr Hammond offered what they called an inadequate idea for tackling aviation emissions.

              <p>Facebook is suffering the most severe outage in its history, with key services rendered unusable for users globally for much of Wednesday. The last time Facebook had a disruption of this magnitude was in 2008, when the site had 150m users - compared to around 2.3bn monthly users today. Facebook's main product, its two messaging apps and image-sharing site Instagram were all affected. The cause of the interruption has not yet been made public. "We're aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps," Facebook said in a statement. "We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible." In response to rumours posted on other social networks, the company said the outages were not a result of a Distributed Denial of Service attack, known as DDoS - a type of cyber-attack that involves flooding a target service with extremely high volumes of traffic.
